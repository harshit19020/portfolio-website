        <h1>Powers the Future and accelarates it.</h1>
        
        <p>In a span of 12 months we have all seen the lowest of the stock market in a decade as well as the highest of it till date.</p>

        <h4>JOIN THE MOVEMENT</h4>
        <p>Stock Market is termed as a place where the phrase fits best that the <span class="heading-inverted">slowest and the steadiest wins the race.</span></p>

        <p>I have seen over last one year that people come here and want to invest and get rich or earn profits from day1 but the person that is most patient out there wins. if we look the market in overview, it looks quite easy and eye-catchy, you just have to invest your money in some stock that is good wait for some time and it will give you returns.
        <br>
        This is true but wait is not everybody's cup of tea. Everyone cannot wait for long times to see the growth. A slight negetive in the portfolio makes them go out from the trade irrespective of how good that company is.
        <br>
        Another thing people don't research about the company much before taking shares, hey see it is going up from 10 days so it will go up on the 111th day as well. This is not done, it is not programming that it will follow a aset pattern, market works on emotion of individuals and the company performance combined.
        </p>

        <h2>INVESTING</h2>


        <p>
            I only know one thing that a good company stock will never ever make u poor. What will happen if SBI, HDFC, RELIANCE, TATA everybody gets destroyed, so there share will also gets destroyed, although its hypothetical to do so but still.
            <br>
            If these companies gets destroyed then the nation is almost on its road, so eventually not only you everyone will be on same level, everybody's gonna sink in.
            <br>
            <span class="heading-inverted">Why and when to invest</span> : The money we used to earn 20 years back is not enough to live the lifestyle we used to live 20 years back. Every essential thing has increased it's price but money doesn't grow just sitting in your accounts or into your locker. Slowly investng a smallamount every month helps you lower the risk of your future life and liabilities as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Investing either directly into the markets or in mutual funds helps you grow your money and keeps you secured for your future life whether some rough phase of your career and you end up having no job, this will help you over there.
        </p>

        <h2>Some Big Sayings</h2>
        <p>Rakesh Jhunjhunwala : The big bull of Dalal Street says that even living life is risky you never know when your body stops working, and you take that risk of believing your on body every single day. So why not have trust in the company that you are consuming on daily basis and you know you are going to use this product for years and years and also there would be millions like you who are using it. If then also you doublt that company, I don't know whom you can trust.</p>

        <p>
            Warren Buffet : says that money kept in the bank and you think it's safe, you are wrong. Bank itself is stealing your money under your nose and you don't even realize it. 
            <br>
            The worls inflation rate is around 6% and the interest that the banks give you on your money is 4.5% something, that means bank is eating minimum of 1.5% of your money ever year compounded over the years. Normal or commom man don't understands it and that's why he is the one who pays for the expenses of the richest. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Warren Buffet also said that if your salary is the only source of income you had then you are just a step away of being poor.
            <br>
            <br>
            He also said if you can't make money money work for you when you are sleeping, then you have not learnt the biggest lesson of the life and you will realize it one day.
