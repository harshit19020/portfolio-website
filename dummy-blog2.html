            <bold>Something about me</bold> : I am Samkit Jain who completed his higher education from Jaipur in MPS Jawahar Nagar. And haan, it's a boy school to make you clear. Till last day I was blessed to be here but the irony was I didin;t understood it early on. When I was in class 7-8, I also used to think that why our school is not co-ed and since there are no girls there is no fun, you know what I wanna say.
        </p>

        <h2>The Magic of Boys All around</h2>
        <p>
            I completely agree that if you are not having co-ed schhol, you will find difficulty first time talking to a girl. But trust me else it's all fun, froom eating the tiffins during the first second period, bunking the whole class with majority number of students with us, each one of our buddy in the class used to support each other.
            <br>
            In a boys school everybody is <span class="heading-inverted">bhai</span> to all, you don't have to be a good friend of other to seek a help from, you just have to say <span class="heading-inverted">bhai ye panga ho gaya, kuch kr</span> and that's it, everybody will make something to figure that issue out. There is so much unity the class that nobody tells others name so that he also gets punished alongside him, and this rule wasn't made it was inculcated from that environment.
        </p>
        

        <h2> A speech by DD Pathak that will be remembered till lifetime</h2>
        <p>
            There was one incident during 11th class. We used to bunk classes but one time the bunking made us pay heavily. There was a school edu-fair and we were strictly given instructions that nobody will bunk the school. But who listens, beside of tight security we planned the escape, but unfortunately 2 of our students were caught and was taken to the principal sir, one of the classmates informed us as well who escaped from there. The 2 students were then asked who else bunked but they didn't utter a single name.
            <br>
            They were given the warning that if they will not tell others names then both of them will be suspended from the school but still that unity was intact. Listeing to all of this our class decided to go the principal's room, only 8-9 students bunked bu whole 50 students went into the room and said we all bunked the school together. The teachers were hell shocked because they knew that all of them didn't bunked and to save the 2 students they are all on one side, <span class="heading-inverted">bhai-bhai bond </span> is much more stronger than suspension.
            <br>
            <span class="heading-inverted">Seeing all of this, Vice principal(disc.) stood up and said that I am proud of you boys and this MPS environment. Our main aim to create a sole boys school was to make an environment where everybody has each others back. I am not saying that what you did is right but the way all of you stood for each other is really great and keep this attitude intact boys, nobody is SUSPENDED, you all can leave.</span>
        </p>

        <h2>So ending</h2>
        <p>
            This is how it was in a boys school, full of masti, next level of pangas we used to take but the one thing that the school taught us the best was that whatever the situation may be, dont leave your friend alone.
